# RunDMC
This is an Intel Edison project that utilizes the Grove platform to start a DMC DeLorean car simply by entering the vehicle.  The car will shut off when you exit.

This is achieved via a combination of bluetooth pairing, a motion sensor, parking brake sensor, and three relays to control the wires within the ignition cylinder.

# Team RunDMC is:
* Drew Alden
* Chris Pavan
* Benon Kerkotchian
